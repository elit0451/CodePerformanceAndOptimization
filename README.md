# Code Performance :robot: and Optimization :stopwatch:

In the early days of cryptography :pager:, analysing the frequency of letters could be used to break encryption. This [java project](https://github.com/CPHBusinessSoftUFO/letterfrequencies) reads a file :page_with_curl: and prints out the frequency :bar_chart: of each of the letters in that file.  
This repository contains code implementation which achieves **51%** faster performance :chart_with_downwards_trend:.

## Current performance of the program :turtle:
We believe that the following performance measurements are free of errors due to the fact that we have **terminated all** the unnecessary background software and run the profiler **10 times** to accomplish consistent results (_in the IDE and also confirmed by running the program the day after the measurements were recorded_). Furthermore, we didn't include the time of `print_tally()` in our analysis, since this method serves only the presentation purposes.

We have plotted our results into a [box-plot](https://goodcalculators.com/box-plot-maker/), which provided us with a good overview of the measurements correlation.

## Bottlenecks in the program <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21998037/68543630-f146bf00-03b9-11ea-9ec1-2e1acc756eb6.jpg" height="40" align="center"> 
One of the main bottlenecks spotted while analyzing the performance results was the file reading. Additionally, we‚Äôve noticed that we would try to use `put()` to verify if there was an exception caused, which would indicate that a _Hashmap_ key didn‚Äôt exist.

## Improvement hypothesis :crystal_ball:
A possibility for dealing with the constant file input would be to simply read the entire file content at once - keeping the data in memory would enable us to perform operations faster. Next step can be to eliminate the little delay the `try`, `catch` blocks might cause by transforming them into an `if-else` statement, using the benefits of the faster `contains` operation as a condition - [commit df356](https://github.com/elit0451/CodePerformanceAndOptimization/commit/df35663eac9a93b27da788d751a36240ebdd2902).

## Improved performance :rabbit2:
The following box-plot demonstrates the results achieved after profiling the code optimization following our hypothesis. The same tactics of closing the background programs and executing 10 times (+ not adding performance results coming from `print_tally()` execution) apply here for the reason of consistency measurements. We have also made use of the `print_tally` method in the sense of comparing the results presented with the original implementation values and they were a 100% match, which proves that we have kept the logic but improve the program performance. With this implementation, we achieved an improvement of **51%** over the original implementation.

</p>

:mag_right: The new **minimum**, **maximum**, **average** and **median** values can be observed as follows:

Min | Max | Mean | Median |
----|:----:|:----:|:----:|
114|218|142.3|132|

</br>
</br>

An overall comparison is demonstrated by the next box-plot diagrams, where **Group 1** :small_blue_diamond: is the old program results and **Group 2** :small_orange_diamond: shows the improved version.
